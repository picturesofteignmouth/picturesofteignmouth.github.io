After leaving university with a trophy degree (Russian and Linguistics) which proved completely unintelligble to the real world, I had a long hard think about what I really was (this was in my twenties having been through 6 years of secondary school and 4 years of higher education).  Deep down inside I had always wanted to do Art so I was now faced with the task of remustering from pragmatic Linguist to imaginative Artist.  A tall order but when you're dealing with your inner persona it's important stuff.
