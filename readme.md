# jekyll-blog
A simple from-scratch blog that doesn't need any JS, is extremely fast and has a bold design.
## TODO:
 - add coloring to code blocks
 - there should be sections to categorize posts
 - small refinements in the design, typography, ETC:
    - tables need better styling
 - a full screen image view (requires JS)
 - copy button for code blocks (can only be done with JS so I am not implementing)
## DONE:
 - 404 page - maybe just change the spacing between 404 and the text
 - get all of the markdown elements looking correct
 - home page
 - posts page
 - external icon on links that point to external websites
